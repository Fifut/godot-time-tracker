# Project Time Tracker (Godot Time Tracker)

Fork of [Godot Time Traker](https://github.com/YuriSizov/godot-time-tracker) by [YuriSizov](https://github.com/YuriSizov)

Modified to suit my personal use

A small editor widget which provides basic functions for tracking your time with the Godot editor. Track which main screen view you are using the most.
